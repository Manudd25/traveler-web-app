# Traveler App

This is an app designed by myself which allows travelers to see what are the facilities provided by the city they're visiting. 
The main idea, is the position is being captured by the geo location and the app will fetch the nearest facilities, attractions and tours.

For now, I added a booking simulation for the restaurant page, the tour page and the cinema page but I will add new features soon, together with a better UX and UI experience. :) 

Technologies used: React, Figma.
